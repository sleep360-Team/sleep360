# 6.4.2 Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process
## 1. Prepare for Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
### a. Identify the stakeholders who have an interest in the software system throughout its lifecycle
Outcome a

This task is reflected in the XP principle of Mutual Benefit, which as [] says, is the "most important XP principle and the most difficult to adhere to"
### b. Define the stakeholder needs and requirements definition strategy.
Outcomes d and e

This task is hard to directly pair to XP, and I would classify it under the category of "unneded or deferrable requirements" that the XP value of Simplicity strives to eliminate.
### c. Identify and plan for the necessary enabling systems or services needed to support stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
Outcome h

Again, this feels like an area where Simplicity should shine through, and the next task should be decided based on what works best at the time.
### d. Obtain or acquire access to the enabling systems or services to be used.
Outcome h

This task fosters the XP values of Communication and Feedback, as since having the extra systems or services may prove to add complexity, it will be greatly worth it if it allows for ease of communication and understanding between the stakeholders and the development team.

## 2. Define stakeholder needs
### a. Define context of use within the concept of operations and the preliminary life cycle concepts.
Outcome b

This task, in some sense, can be boiled down to the concents of stories and themes, which will be touched on more in the next task. However, there is definitely room for cutting out the extra in the name of Simplicity.
### b. Identify stakeholder needs.
Outcome d

This task can be fulfilled via the creation of weekly stories and quarterly themes, which are the stakeholder needs embodied and seek to replace requirements and the aire of "absolutism and permanence" that surrounds them, as is said in Chapter 7.
### c. Prioritize and down-select needs
Outcome e

This is fulfilled in the planning that XP does allow, by the rating of stories. For example, in Chapter 12 of the textbook, it is stated that "When choosing which stories to implement, sort them several ways," showing the importance of properly selecting stories.
### d. Define the stakeholder needs and rationale.
Outcome d

This is the first step in making manifest the work done in creating stories and themes, fleshing them out to properly meet the stakeholder needs.
## 3. Develop the operation concept and other life cycle concepts
### a. Define a representative set of scenarios to identify the required capabilities that correspond to anticipated operation and other life cycle concepts.
Outcome b

This is firmly the creation of user stories, and (as has been discussed in setting up user stories) fits very cleanly into the ideals of XP.
### b. Identify the factors affecting interactions between users and the system.
    i) Anticipated physical, mental, and learned capabilities of the users;
    ii) Workplace, environment and facilities, indlucing other equipment in the clontext of use;
    iii) Normal, unusual, and emergency conditions; and
    iv) Operator and user recruitment, training, and culture.

Outcomes e and f

Considering the XP value of Respect and the principle of Humanity, I would say this is built-in to the operations of XP. The entire system is built around (as has been mentioned earlier) mutual benefit for all involved, meaning that having an understanding of how the users will interact with the system and what it will mean to them is paramount to making a good system.
## 4. Transform stakeholder needs into stakeholder requirements.
### a. Identify the constraints on a system solution.
Outcome c

This falls under the planning that is allowed for XP: while full "requirements gathering" is not ideal under the system, understanding what you can and cannot do is simple necessity.
### b. Identify the stakeholder requirements and functions that relate to critical quality characteristics, such as assurance, safety, security, environment, or health.
Outcomes e and f

Again, this may not be done explicitly as "requirements gathering" as it typically would, but keeping in mind the values of Communication and Feedback, as well as the principles of Improvement and Reflection, should make these characteristics apparent as progress is made.
### c. Define stakeholder requirements consistent with life cycle concepts, scenarios, interactions, constraints, and critical quality characteristics.
Outcomes e and f

Much like the last task, I believe this one does fit cleanly into XP, but will overall be accomplished in the process.
## 5. Analyze stakeholder requirements. 
### a. Analyze the complete set of stakeholder requirements.
Outcome e

This task can be met with the designing that XP allows, as long as they focus on simplicity, for the sake of both the stakeholders and for the project team.
### b. Define critical performance measures that enable the assessment of technical achievement.
Outcome f

This task feels like one that can be pared away in the name of simplicity, although it may very well fit into the design phase, depending on the project at hand.
### c. Feed back the analyzed requirements to applicable stakeholders to validate that their needs and expectations have been adequately captured and expressed.
Outcome g

This task should be met naturally in communication with the stakeholders, presuming specific requirements are even made in the first place, considering the importance of understanding and communicating in XP.
### d. Resolve stakeholder requirements issues.
Outcome g

This task is directly met with the XP value of Feedback, as resolving the issues that stakeholders have is the entire point of receiving their feedback.
## 6. Manage the stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
### a. Obtain explicit agreement with designated stakeholder needs and requirements.
Outcome g

This task is mostly met with the XP values of Communication and Respect, as while the process may not be as formal as the language suggests, having respect for the client will mean considering their needs and requirements in every step and making sure with them that those needs and requirements are met.
### b. Maintain traceability of stakeholder needs and requirements.
Outcome i

This task should be met by the XP principle of Reflection, as while it may not be done formally, reflecting on what the team has done should naturally include how those actions meet the needs and requirements of client.
### c. Provide key artifacts and information items that have been selected for baselines.
Outcome g

This task is met again via Communication and Feedback, as well as during meetings with the client, whether on the weekly or quarterly scale. If the corollary practice of Real Customer Involvement is utilized, that provides even more opportunity to meet this task.

### Select and prioritize design principles and design characteristicss
- Outcome: e. Design alternatives for system elements are assessed.
- By analyzing various options for design principle and characteristics, developers consider alternatives for their design. They best do this through a single shared codebase which forces developers to work cohesively so the design pattern makes sense for other parts of the system
